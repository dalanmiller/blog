It's about time that I got started blogging again. 

It's been a long time coming and I started out wanting to run my new blog site on [Jekyl](http://jekyllrb.com/) or [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde) but I finally settled on the very nascent [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/) to which I hope I can contribute. As well I will be writing a few articles on getting started with Hugo while also making the documentation better, because it needs some work.  

Part of this is learning Google's new-ish lagnguage called [Go](http://golang.org/). Mostly because it isn't Javascript and it's very fast and easy to deploy. 

I'd like to also keep stretching design and creativity muscles and not just pretend like I can. Also it's important to [Always Be Coding](https://medium.com/tech-talk/d5f8051afce2). 

Plus, static site blogs are what all the cool kids are doing and [I'm so cool](http://instagram.com/p/YdIsh_nLfo/). 

So here goes.
