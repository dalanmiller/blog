I've thought many times over how one weekend in July of 2011 has changed my life forever. 

But one that just came recently is now that I'm currently in grad school at Carnegie Mellon is that I see so many of my colleagues being willfully complacent in their knowledge of things.

The thing is that Startup Weekend makes you interact with so many 'doers'. People are are talented and from the get-go are proactive about solutions to problems. It's in this type of scenarios where people became ultra-successful and I think can be glaringly contrasted to the traditional education system.

See, I think the mindset of most people who enter college is that surely once I finish my four years (and perhaps more education after undergrad) some company will roll out the red carpet because now I have my piece of fancy paper. This is woefully not the case (with a caveat). And I believe that people attend grad school looking for much the same. 

I think we need to differentiate the title of school with the workmanship of an individual.
